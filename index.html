                <h2>Why Block Island?</h2>
                <h3>New England's Island Gem</h3>
                <p>If busy beach destinations aren’t your thing, consider Block Island, 19 kilometers off the coast of Rhode Island. Block Island features 17 miles of pristine beaches, protected by lighthouses and spectacular bluffs, surrounded by rolling roads and winding paths.</p>
                <p>You’ll be instantly attracted to the beautiful, crisp waters lapping at the island’s shore. Explore one-of-a-kind shops, stop for a relaxing meal and book a room at one of the cozy inns at the Old Harbor area fronting the Atlantic Ocean, or the smaller New Harbor on Great Salt Pond. Go sailing, kayaking, paddle boarding, parasailing or fishing. Rent a bike and explore the island at your own pace.</p>

                            <p>
                                Southeast Light is one of the two lights on the island, and the easiest to access. It’s grounds offer amazing views out over the Atlantic, including the island’s best perspective on the new Block Island Windfarm located three miles offshore. Built in 1875, the lighthouse has a 52-foot brick and granite tower, and has been named a National Historic Landmark.

                                The lighthouse and gift shop are open during the summer. A Tower Tour is a great way to learn all about the lighthouse and shipwrecks along Block Island shores. The grounds of the lighthouse, with stunning views of the bluffs and the Wind Farm, are open year-round.

                            <p>
                                The beach at the base of the 200-foot tall Mohegan Bluffs is perhaps the most beautiful on the island, harboring a secluded, if rocky, place to swim and surf. It’s a bit of a climb to get there with a set of 141 steps leading down to the sand. These clay cliffs offer one of the most dramatic views of the Atlantic, a vista that can extend all the way to Montauk on the tip of Long Island.

                            <p>
                                The beauty of this natural landscape is juxtaposed with it's tragic history. In a battle for the island in the 16th century, the Mohegans were forced over the cliffs to their deaths by the Niantic natives.
